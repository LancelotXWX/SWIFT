SWIFT is a lightweight and efficient model for **Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF)** that integrates **wavelet decomposition**, **cross-band information fusion**, and **sub-series mapping** techniques to improve forecasting accuracy, especially in resource-constrained environments.

## ðŸš€ Features  

- **Wavelet-based Lossless Downsampling**: Uses **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** for effective time-frequency analysis.  
- **Cross-band Information Fusion**: Learns a **shared representation** across different frequency bands.  
- **Minimalist Model Design**: Employs a **single-layer linear** or **shallow MLP** for sub-series mapping.  
- **Superior Performance**: Achieves **state-of-the-art (SOTA)** results with **only 25%** of the parameters of a standard linear model.  
- **Optimized for Edge Devices**: Suitable for **low-computation environments** with fast inference speed.
